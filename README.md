    - **Macronutrients Distribution (Pie Chart)**: Shows the percentage distribution of proteins, fats, and carbs in your diet.
    - **Macronutrients Distribution (Bar Chart)**: Compares your actual intake of proteins, fats, and carbs with your goals.
    - **Calories Goal Progress (Pie Chart)**: Shows the percentage of your calorie goal that you've consumed and what remains.
    - **Calories Goal Progress Over Time (Line Chart)**: Tracks your cumulative calorie intake over time against your calorie goal.
